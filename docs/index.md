# HSCS.io API

The HSCS.io API allows users and CTF organizers to take advantage of the HSCS.io infrastructure beyond the functionalities that are offered on the website. Currently, the HSCS.io API is in beta, and many features are experimental. If anything breaks, don't be afraid to leave an issue or shoot us an email.
