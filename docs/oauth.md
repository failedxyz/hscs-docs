In the HSCS.io API, OAuth2 serves as a protocol that allows CTF organizers to get information about their participants through the HSCS.io infrastructure without explicitly getting identification materials such as their email or password.

In order to begin using the API's OAuth2 features, you must first register your CTF through the CTF application form.
