# Introduction

The HSCS.io API has many endpoints. User-specific endpoints and team-specific endpoints will require you to have obtained an access token, through the method above. If you have not received an access token from your user, please follow the steps above. On the other hand, CTF-specific endpoints will require your `api_key`, which you received when you registered your CTF.
